# BangBang bot

Bang Bang bot is an autoclicker designed to play the flash first person shooter game, Bloody Day in Chrome.  Once running, the bot
takes over the role of the player with shooting accuracy as good as or better than a person.  The name of the bot comes from it's
filename on my dad's computer when I was a kid.  Personally, I'd like to know when exactly it stopped being Bang Bang and
magically became Bloody Day but whatever, it's called bang bang bot now.

### Prerequisites

In order to use Bang Bang bot, python 3x is required and pyautogui installed.  Pyautogui can be installed with the command `pip
install pyautogui`.

### Using BangBang bot

To install and use, download the repository or copy the contents of the `bin` folder and place them into a single directory. 
[Start the flash game up in chrome.](http://www.bngames.com/games/bloody-day-1/full_screen.html). Then run the program, for
example `python your\directory\bin\bangbang.py`, from the command line.  To quit the application, enter `Ctrl + c` in the command
line.

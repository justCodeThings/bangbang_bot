# Bang Bang bot

Bang Bang bot is an autoclicker designed to play the first person shooter flash game, Bloody Day, in Chrome.  The bot
takes over the role of the player with shooting accuracy as good as, or better than, a mere mortal.  The name of the bot comes from it's
filename on my dad's computer when I was a kid.  And quite personally, I'd like to know when exactly it stopped being Bang Bang and
magically became Bloody Day but whatever man, it's called bang bang bot now.

### Prerequisites

Bang Bang bot requires Python 3x and pyautogui to be installed.  Pyautogui can be installed with the command `pip
install pyautogui`.

1. Download the repository or copy the contents of the `bin` folder and place them into a single directory. 
2. [Start the flash game up.](http://www.bngames.com/games/bloody-day-1/full_screen.html) Preferably in Chrome.  It's not been tested in other browers. 
3. Run the program.  For example `python your\directory\bin\bangbang.py`, from the command line.

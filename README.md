#BangBang bot

	Bang Bang bot is an autoclicker designed to play the flash first person shooter game, Bloody Day in Chrome.  Once running, the bot takes over the role of the player with shooting accuracy as good as or better than a person.  The name of the bot comes from it's filename on my dad's computer when I was a kid.  Personally, I'd like to know when exactly it stopped being Bang Bang and magically became Bloody Day but whatever, it's called bang bang bot now.

###Prerequisites

	In order to use Bang Bang bot, python 3x is required and pyautogui installed.  Pyautogui can be installed with the command `pip install pyautogui`.

###Using BangBang bot
